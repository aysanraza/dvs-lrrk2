Deep virtual screening system for lrrk2
## Rationale
LRRK2 is a probable drug target for targeted drug therapy in Parkinson Disease. Machine Learning based virtual screening systems are overtaking the traditional computer-aided drug design screening systems. There is a need for the development of LRRK2 virtual screening system to put forth the targeted drug interventions in Parkinson Disease.
## Introduction
dvs-lrrk2 is a deep learning based virtual screening system for LRRK2. The ML based software takes in high dimensional molecular descriptors of chemical compounds as input and predicts their inhibition ability against the LRRK2 protein.
